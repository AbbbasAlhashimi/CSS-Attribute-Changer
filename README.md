# CSS-Attribute-Changer
Pressing the button will switch the DIV styling upon changing the array index value
The background color of Div with ID [wrapper] will switch value upon the selected index value of the array.<br>
The array is called colors and values are ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'maroon','Crimson','Teal','Sienna'].<br>
Whenever the button is clicked, the function passes bckground colors along with their pointed index value. <br>
In every comparison procedure, the function ensures that array index is in continuous switch.
